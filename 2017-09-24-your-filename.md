### Blogging Workflow
Are there plugins for prose.io? I could use a spell checker.

I would like to integrate my blogging workflow into the command line. This could be done using a fish/vim/git stack. I will have macros such as **New Draft**, **new Post**, **Publish** 

I wonder if there is such a thing as a **fish environment**. For example, it would be nice to have a fish environment, **Blogging**, in which the above fush functions are defined.

I need to be able to call fish functions from within vim. I bet this can be done with !<command>
