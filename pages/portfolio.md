I made this website as an outline for a business idea I had in Fall 2016, something along the lines of Cryptocurrency investment consulting firm. The idea is that if you could have a physical store front where customers can come in and purchase a very simple crypto-investment plan, similar to mutual funds at the bank, then you tap into a large demographic of people which are marginalized from the crypto-investment space due to inadequate internet navigating skills.
