What would the architecture of a system which allows anyone in the world speak to anuone else in the world anonoumosly. 
Like an anonoumos twitter. Imagine a simple web page with whith a search box. Like Google, but nice and modern. You type a name in the search box and it will
return a few faces which are most likely people you would like to talk to. You select a person from the list. It opens a chat dialoug and you can speak with them completely anonymously guaranteed.
When you close the browser there is no trace that you ever sent it.

Log in with facebook. be able to send a message to any user of the app. the message is encryped in the browser and sent internally to the other user. if they log in with 
facebook they can see the message.
