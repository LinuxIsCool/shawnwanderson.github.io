Are there other people out there like me? I graduated with a cs degree. Now I do webdev contracting for 20 dollars an hour. I work from home. I work about 4 hours 
a week on weekdays, and then I spend another 4 hours tinkering as a software engineer. By tinkering I mean, reading subreddits like webdev, python, and machinelearning.
Mostly machine learning.  

Actually, to be more specific, I get up in the morning, sometime between 7:30 and 9:00. I make oats for breakfast, after drinking a litre of water, either plane or with lemon.
I doctor up my oats with frozen berries, peanut butter, chia seeds, sliced banana, mape syrup, and cashew milk. After my oats i brush my teeth with toothpaste powder from
lush. I walk to either one of the remedy, second cup, starbucks. or I walk to campus and work there. I live about a 10 minute walk from campus. On the walk I listen to
a podcast. Either Joe Rogan, Duncan Trussel, 99PI, or Software Engineering daily.
