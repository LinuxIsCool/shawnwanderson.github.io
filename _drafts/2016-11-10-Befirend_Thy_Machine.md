think of the compiler as a buddy that you are throwing ideas back and fourth with. Like you guys are shooting the shit, trying to peice something together
like an old memory. You are like "Yo remember that time like 8 years ago when we were chillin at my place in yk, talking about how fast time goes by. Well think
about how much time has gone by sonce then." and your buddy os like " naw dude, we were at my place in olds, that wouldn't make any sence, because I never was at your moms pace in yellowkige when you..."
anyways you get the point. The compiler has to be you friend! There is no other option if you wish to succeed at programming. If you still see the compiler as a 
devious foe then you are looking at programming wrong.

The compiler only tells you the truth. It does not in any way try to be nice to you. It communicates in the clearest way it can, how it can attempt to help you. It
simply attempts to point out the differenced between your mental model of how reality is, and actual concrete reality. It is the ultimate guru. If you have a mental
model of the series of logical steps that must occur in order to transform some input into some desired output, then the compiler will let you know if your idea is flawed.
Atleast, this is the way of thinking for functional
