I Jog a lot. My friends call me a deer person. I also don't eat meat. People don't like me for what I eat. People say gross when I make something really delicious.
My friends say that I don't kill enough. They watch a lot of movies. Ive never been into horror movies I don't get it.
 
 Vegans don't hate me. They are nice people. I'm just a filthy halfling. Don't I look like a deer though? I am very much like a deer. I wonder if not eating
 meat did this to me or if it's just natural. In all seriousnous I do believe this changes me as a person. I think a significant diet choice like choosing to eat meat
 would have a very significant effect on someones personallity.
