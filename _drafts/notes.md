the most powerfull api's for hackers
Blog title: A Millenial Hacker's Rise to Power
This blog is to serve as a reference manual for those who find themselves in my position. I will document what I beleive are the most important decision's that I have made
and that I continue making. I believe that doing this will have positive affect in my life, in fact I think it will be potentially highly rewarding, as it could lead to success
in many ways. consider:

1. I find writing to be thereputic. It allows me to organize my thoughts.
2. I often have ideas which I find very interesting, if I do not write them down then I forget them.
3. Many of the ideas that I have are project ideas which have potential career and monetary rewards
Even if there are no monetary or career rewards from these ideas, there is guarenteed educational benefit.

Title: APIs are the new wild west of technology. Web APIs specifically.
---
The highest level language that exists right now  is web APIs. If you can learn this language, learn to plug these technologies into eachother very easily and efficiently,
For example: Imagine connecting wikipedia and google images (or a much better image api) to create a four dimensional model of reality as we humans know it. You can walk
any where in the known universe at any time that that part of the universe was known. I guess this is like time travel. We can travel anywhere in out 4 dimensional universe
depending on how much information about that time and location is preserved. To clarify, consider how much information is being collected about the current happenings on the
surface of planet earth. If this data is preserved and continued to be observed and clarified and confirmed to be coherent with true reality at that space-time, then we are
able to experience that space-time from any other space time using virtual realities. You can already do this on wikipedia, you can travel through every known peice of human
information. Not only is all the information there, but it is there forever, it is only growing, it is freely accessible, but it is spacially coherent.

That is some interesting math. Compare the graphical structure of wikipedia with the graphical structure of space time. Wikipedia is actually so interesting. It is like a 
structured internet. It is a spacial homomorphism of causal events in reality.
Is wikipedia a graphical homomorphism to human explored 4-dimensional space-time?

vim tab complete is nice for prose actually. I plan to spend a day optimizing vim for prose.

Title: Manifesto
---

IDEA: post a blog that says I need to optimize vim for prose. Ask the public
for advice. give them one week to post/respond (implement comments, and github integration),  And then at the end of the week, live stream yourself going through the
process of optimizing vim for blogging!

Current Blog Stack:

Ubuntu
Vim
Jekyll
Github Pages

To Optimize:

vim for prose
commands from vim? git from vim? Can I generate front-matter from a Jekyll command?

Now adays it seems to me that every software engineer or technology developer is soposed to have a blog. So I want to figure out what is the laziest way
to have a full funtioning, beautiful blog that is very easy to maintain and make interesting posts. So I have been playing around with this for a couple months
as a side project. Check out my current stack:

OS: Ubuntu
I switched from windows to Ubuntu Linux about a year ago. Since the switch my productivity as a computing science student went up several fold. I became much more
motivated in my courses, much more curious. Of course it was a slow process. In the first six months I was just using ubuntu as windows with less features, but then
it started to click. I Started to understand how to be a  <a href="#">hacker</a>. 


Github is an amazing tool for open source software collaboration. But what about other things?
Websites
Novels
Organizations
Activists
Community Projects
Companies
