I never though I missed out on anything growing up without a dad. It never bothered me, and I had always felt as though I was just as equipped for life as men who had
grown up with a father. Until I hit my twenties. All of a sudden I am not a child anymore. I need to make real decisions in life. My life is in my own hands, I need to 
find money for myself or I will starve. I don't know about other people, but all of a sudden feeling as though you have transitioned from a child to a man is a scary thing.
It is the first time in my life that I have felt as though I don't know if I am living my life correctly.

Well so far everything has been working out incredibly. I am happy every single day, I have an amazing life, an amazing girlfriend, I am in good shape both mentally and
physically. I am learning more and more every day. I owe this success to some powerful males whom I have chosen to study and take lessons from in lue of having a father.
This method has worked out incredibly well for me, perhaps in these moder times it is more advantageous to have a hand selected bunch of puplic figures, after which you can 
build your model of reality,
