Imagine with me for a second. A business model that builds on an open source, free software model. But not just for it's software production, but in completely how it
structures it's people. Like right now we have capitalism and government. Two very successful methods that are now out dated. Imagine an open company, governed by open democratic
principles, all technology in their stack is open source and I mean all of it! Money, transportation, communication. Everybody is exactly equal, unless the organization
governs otherwise. 

I am not saying this would be succesful, but imagine with me that it is successful. It is more of a metaphor. Standing in for the concept of a technology driven utopia. This
could happen by any number of unthinkable ways. It certainly sounds to me like a possible future.
