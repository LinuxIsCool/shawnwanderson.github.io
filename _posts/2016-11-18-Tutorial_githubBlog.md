Have you ever wanted to start a blog? Everybody has some stories to tell. Everybody makes jokes that no one else could have thought of. Well there is this new platform called
github pages. Notice the url of this page. You may have heard of or used github.com before, it's a website that allows software engineers to host there code in a nice place
online so that they can collaborate remotely with other developers. What most people don't realize is that github is revolutionizing the way that someone can have their own
website. With github pages you can collaberate on building any kind of website, from a blog, to an online game, to a cv web page, to a business website. You can host it on 
github for free!! Yeah github will host one free website for any user (Registration is free). You can start a blog in 10 minutes right now if you want, you will not have to 
give anyone your credit card number or anything like that. If you would like to pay someone to make your website, it has never been cheaper or easier to have that done.
Use this platform to pay developers to build your website. The internet is the ultimate tool for capitalism. Give every single person in the world the opportunity to
complete a task. Whoever is most well suited for the task (Relative to the wage) Then they will be selected to complete the task.
