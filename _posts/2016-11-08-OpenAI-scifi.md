title: Openai - The singularity
---

It's the year 2023. India has skyrocketed into the number one most successful technology based economy. They have an open source revolution. It's a bump in progress equivelent to
capitolism, except much higher on the logarithmic scale. It blasts India from its global economic status from where it is now to a place of infinite abundance. They quickly disarm
the world leaders of all the power that they have now and they replace the status quo to create a global utopia. Then suddenly in 2013, God arrives. Just as duncan trussel discusses,
we are a self contructing summoning device. We are opening a portal to another dimension. God just beams into our existence and says thank you your work is done.
Everyone who has ever lived will now come back to life. There will never again be scarcity or fear. You can literally do what ever you want with no repurcusions. Enjoy the rest of
eternity. See ya!

Imagine with me for a second. A business model that builds on an open source, free software model. But not just for it's software production, but in completely how it
structures it's people. Like right now we have capitalism and government. Two very successful methods that are now out dated. Imagine an open company, governed by open democratic
principles, all technology in their stack is open source and I mean all of it! Money, transportation, communication. Everybody is exactly equal, unless the organization
governs otherwise. 

I am not saying this would be succesful, but imagine with me that it is successful. It is more of a metaphor. Standing in for the concept of a technology driven utopia. This
could happen by any number of unthinkable ways. It certainly sounds to me like a possible future.

title: Tutorial: How to contribute to a github blog
---
Have you ever wanted to start a blog? Everybody has some stories to tell. Everybody makes jokes that no one else could have thought of. Well there is this new platform called
github pages. Notice the url of this page. You may have heard of or used github.com before, it's a website that allows software engineers to host there code in a nice place
online so that they can collaborate remotely with other developers. What most people don't realize is that github is revolutionizing the way that someone can have their own
website. With github pages you can collaberate on building any kind of website, from a blog, to an online game, to a cv web page, to a business website. You can host it on 
github for free!! Yeah github will host one free website for any user (Registration is free). You can start a blog in 10 minutes right now if you want, you will not have to 
give anyone your credit card number or anything like that. If you would like to pay someone to make your website, it has never been cheaper or easier to have that done.
Use this platform to pay developers to build your website. The internet is the ultimate tool for capitalism. Give every single person in the world the opportunity to
complete a task. Whoever is most well suited for the task (Relative to the wage) Then they will be selected to complete the task.

think of the compiler as a buddy that you are throwing ideas back and fourth with. Like you guys are shooting the shit, trying to peice something together
like an old memory. You are like "Yo remember that time like 8 years ago when we were chillin at my place in yk, talking about how fast time goes by. Well think
about how much time has gone by sonce then." and your buddy os like " naw dude, we were at my place in olds, that wouldn't make any sence, because I never was at your moms pace in yellowkige when you..."
anyways you get the point. The compiler has to be you friend! There is no other option if you wish to succeed at programming. If you still see the compiler as a 
devious foe then you are looking at programming wrong.

The compiler only tells you the truth. It does not in any way try to be nice to you. It communicates in the clearest way it can, how it can attempt to help you. It
simply attempts to point out the differenced between your mental model of how reality is, and actual concrete reality. It is the ultimate guru. If you have a mental
model of the series of logical steps that must occur in order to transform some input into some desired output, then the compiler will let you know if your idea is flawed.
Atleast, this is the way of thinking for functional

What would the architecture of a system which allows anyone in the world speak to anuone else in the world anonoumosly. 
Like an anonoumos twitter. Imagine a simple web page with whith a search box. Like Google, but nice and modern. You type a name in the search box and it will
return a few faces which are most likely people you would like to talk to. You select a person from the list. It opens a chat dialoug and you can speak with them completely anonymously guaranteed.
When you close the browser there is no trace that you ever sent it.

Log in with facebook. be able to send a message to any user of the app. the message is encryped in the browser and sent internally to the other user. if they log in with 
facebook they can see the message.

re there other people out there like me? I graduated with a cs degree. Now I do webdev contracting for 20 dollars an hour. I work from home. I work about 4 hours 
a week on weekdays, and then I spend another 4 hours tinkering as a software engineer. By tinkering I mean, reading subreddits like webdev, python, and machinelearning.
Mostly machine learning.  

Actually, to be more specific, I get up in the morning, sometime between 7:30 and 9:00. I make oats for breakfast, after drinking a litre of water, either plane or with lemon.
I doctor up my oats with frozen berries, peanut butter, chia seeds, sliced banana, mape syrup, and cashew milk. After my oats i brush my teeth with toothpaste powder from
lush. I walk to either one of the remedy, second cup, starbucks. or I walk to campus and work there. I live about a 10 minute walk from campus. On the walk I listen to
a podcast. Either Joe Rogan, Duncan Trussel, 99PI, or Software Engineering daily.

1. Duncan Trussel Family hour
I have been listening to the Joe Rogan Experience since it was in double digit episodes. I remember laying on my floor in my first year of University, listening to Joe talk
about vampire pussy. Back then I had two male personalities that I looked up to and took guidance from, that was Joe Rogan, and David Choe. I watch David Choe Thumbs Up
America back when it was very briefly on Netflix. That changed my life forever.

title: The three most prominent male role models in my life.

I never though I missed out on anything growing up without a dad. It never bothered me, and I had always felt as though I was just as equipped for life as men who had
grown up with a father. Until I hit my twenties. All of a sudden I am not a child anymore. I need to make real decisions in life. My life is in my own hands, I need to 
find money for myself or I will starve. I don't know about other people, but all of a sudden feeling as though you have transitioned from a child to a man is a scary thing.
It is the first time in my life that I have felt as though I don't know if I am living my life correctly.

Well so far everything has been working out incredibly. I am happy every single day, I have an amazing life, an amazing girlfriend, I am in good shape both mentally and
physically. I am learning more and more every day. I owe this success to some powerful males whom I have chosen to study and take lessons from in lue of having a father.
This method has worked out incredibly well for me, perhaps in these moder times it is more advantageous to have a hand selected bunch of puplic figures, after which you can 
build your model of reality,
