It's the year 2023. India has skyrocketed into the number one most successful technology based economy. They have an open source revolution. It's a bump in progress equivelent to
capitolism, except much higher on the logarithmic scale. It blasts India from its global economic status from where it is now to a place of infinite abundance. They quickly disarm
the world leaders of all the power that they have now and they replace the status quo to create a global utopia. Then suddenly in 2013, God arrives. Just as duncan trussel discusses,
we are a self contructing summoning device. We are opening a portal to another dimension. God just beams into our existence and says thank you your work is done.
Everyone who has ever lived will now come back to life. There will never again be scarcity or fear. You can literally do what ever you want with no repurcusions. Enjoy the rest of
eternity. See ya!
