title: Openai - The singularity
---

It's the year 2023. India has skyrocketed into the number one most successful technology based economy. They have an open source revolution. It's a bump in progress equivelent to
capitolism, except much higher on the logarithmic scale. It blasts India from its global economic status from where it is now to a place of infinite abundance. They quickly disarm
the world leaders of all the power that they have now and they replace the status quo to create a global utopia. Then suddenly in 2013, God arrives. Just as duncan trussel discusses,
we are a self contructing summoning device. We are opening a portal to another dimension. God just beams into our existence and says thank you your work is done.
Everyone who has ever lived will now come back to life. There will never again be scarcity or fear. You can literally do what ever you want with no repurcusions. Enjoy the rest of
eternity. See ya!

Imagine with me for a second. A business model that builds on an open source, free software model. But not just for it's software production, but in completely how it
structures it's people. Like right now we have capitalism and government. Two very successful methods that are now out dated. Imagine an open company, governed by open democratic
principles, all technology in their stack is open source and I mean all of it! Money, transportation, communication. Everybody is exactly equal, unless the organization
governs otherwise. 

I am not saying this would be succesful, but imagine with me that it is successful. It is more of a metaphor. Standing in for the concept of a technology driven utopia. This
could happen by any number of unthinkable ways. It certainly sounds to me like a possible future.

title: Tutorial: How to contribute to a github blog
---
Have you ever wanted to start a blog? Everybody has some stories to tell. Everybody makes jokes that no one else could have thought of. Well there is this new platform called
github pages. Notice the url of this page. You may have heard of or used github.com before, it's a website that allows software engineers to host there code in a nice place
online so that they can collaborate remotely with other developers. What most people don't realize is that github is revolutionizing the way that someone can have their own
website. With github pages you can collaberate on building any kind of website, from a blog, to an online game, to a cv web page, to a business website. You can host it on 
github for free!! Yeah github will host one free website for any user (Registration is free). You can start a blog in 10 minutes right now if you want, you will not have to 
give anyone your credit card number or anything like that. If you would like to pay someone to make your website, it has never been cheaper or easier to have that done.
Use this platform to pay developers to build your website. The internet is the ultimate tool for capitalism. Give every single person in the world the opportunity to
complete a task. Whoever is most well suited for the task (Relative to the wage) Then they will be selected to complete the task.

think of the compiler as a buddy that you are throwing ideas back and fourth with. Like you guys are shooting the shit, trying to peice something together
like an old memory. You are like "Yo remember that time like 8 years ago when we were chillin at my place in yk, talking about how fast time goes by. Well think
about how much time has gone by sonce then." and your buddy os like " naw dude, we were at my place in olds, that wouldn't make any sence, because I never was at your moms pace in yellowkige when you..."
anyways you get the point. The compiler has to be you friend! There is no other option if you wish to succeed at programming. If you still see the compiler as a 
devious foe then you are looking at programming wrong.

The compiler only tells you the truth. It does not in any way try to be nice to you. It communicates in the clearest way it can, how it can attempt to help you. It
simply attempts to point out the differenced between your mental model of how reality is, and actual concrete reality. It is the ultimate guru. If you have a mental
model of the series of logical steps that must occur in order to transform some input into some desired output, then the compiler will let you know if your idea is flawed.
Atleast, this is the way of thinking for functional
